## Causes and development

In the case of glaucoma, damage to the optic cells on the retina or to the optic nerve at the entry point to the eyeball is caused by circulatory disorders. As the disease progresses, the affected cells die off. <br>
The reason for the disturbed blood circulation is an imbalance between intraocular pressure and the pressure within the blood vessels of the retina and the optic nerve (perfusion pressure). If the intraocular pressure is too high compared to the perfusion pressure, the blood vessels are cut off. The result is a lack of oxygen and nutrients in the affected photoreceptors. <br><br>
There can be various reasons for the pressure/disproportion. The most common are:

- **deposits in the anterior chamber of the eye** obstruct the drainage of aqueous humor, making the chamber too full and exerting pressure on the vitreous body of the eye. The result is increased intraocular pressure. This glaucoma cause is mainly age-related. The probability of such deposits increases with increasing age.
- **low perfusion pressure** in the blood vessels as a result of which the normal pressure inside the eye is too high relative to the perfusion pressure (normal pressure glaucoma).
- **cardiovascular diseases**
- **general low blood pressure**
- **high blood pressure (hypertension)** as it can damage the blood vessel walls.
- **diabetes / metabolic diseases** <br>
**and more...**

## Symptoms

As a result of the death of underserved cells, the affected person loses vision in the affected areas. If more and more sensory cells die in an area, local blindness / loss of visual field (scotomas) occurs. Since our brain usually compensates for such failures (as it also more or less removes our nose from the field of vision), the affected person often notices the creeping restriction of the field of vision only late. <br>
Further symptoms occur above all with a glaucoma attack. This is a sudden, high pressure increase in the eye. If such a seizure remains untreated, it can lead to the complete loss of vision of the affected eyes.<br>
Symptoms of glaucoma attacks are: <br>
- **redness and swelling of the eye**
- **hardening of the eyeball**
- **seething eye**
- **enlarged pupil and lack of response to light**
- **headaches, nausea and vomiting**
- **more rarely cardiac arrhythmia and circulatory collapse.**


## Distribution

In Germany, increased intraocular pressure (precursor of glaucoma) occurs in about three million people. About 800,000 people (< 1% of the population) suffer from glaucoma.<br>
The likelihood of disease increases sharply with age. Glaucoma (including precursors) occurs in 2.4% of people over 40 years of age. From the age of 75 already in 7-8% of people.


## Therapy

Glaucoma is treated by standard medication (eye drops), the effect of which is to lower intraocular pressure. <br>
If the drug treatment is not sufficient, surgery must be performed. There are different approaches to reduce the chamber pressure. (Reduction of aqueous humor production, insertion of a small tube to facilitate drainage, creation of an artificial drainage path).<br>
If the cause of glaucoma is not too high intraocular pressure, this cause must be treated directly (e.g. metabolic diseases, low blood pressure);
