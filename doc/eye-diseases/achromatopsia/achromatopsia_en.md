## Causes and development

In people affected by achromatopsia (so-called achromats), the cones, the visual cells on the retina that are responsible for color warning, do not function.
Achromatopsia is congenital and is caused by a recessive hereditary disease.


## Symptoms

The view is severely impaired in various respects by the failing of the cones:

- **Colour blindness:**<br>
Since there are no functional cones, no or almost no colours can be perceived.
- **Strongly reduced visual acuity:**<br>
On a healthy retina, the cones are responsible for sharp vision in daylight. In addition, only a few of the remaining functional rods are present in the centre of the visual field, as they usually contain mainly cones.
- **Involuntary eye movement (Nystagmus):**<br>
In the macula, the place of sharpest vision in the middle of the retina, are only cones and no rods. Achromats therefore have no functional photoreceptors at this point. The affected person tries involuntarily to compensate by fast eye movements.
- **Strong glare sensitivity (Photophobia):**<br>
Rods are not designed for large amounts of light. In a healthy retina, the rods are inhibited by the cones in bright light; in achromats, however, this is not the case and the rods are overloaded by bright light.


## Distribution

Total colour blindness is extremely rare: Only about 0.002% of all people are affected.


## Therapy

Congenital achromatopsia cannot be treated at present. However, edge filter glasses or tinted contact lenses can be used to reduce glare.
