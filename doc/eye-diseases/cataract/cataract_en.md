## Causes and development

In the case of cataract, the, otherwise clear, eye lens becomes cloudy. This can have a multitude of causes.<br>
The most common form of cataract is the age-related cataract, which occurs from the age of 60. However, it can also be hereditary or <br>
be caused by other risk factors. These include, for example:

- **Radiation exposure (UV light, lightning)**
- **smoking / excessive alcohol consumption**
- **myotonic dystrophy (hereditary muscle disease)**
- **metabolic diseases such as diabetes**
- **nutrient deficiency**
- **medication (cortisone)**
- **for newborns: damage during pregnancy**

## Symptoms

Cataract is characterized by increasingly blurred vision and increased glare sensitivity. <br>
Other symptoms are low-contrast vision and the impression of looking through a veil or fog.<br>
The symptoms can initially be limited to smaller regions and only take up the entire field of vision as the disease progresses.

## Distribution

In Germany between 52 and 64 years approx. 50% of the population suffer from cataracts, but without being aware of them.<br>
In the age group between 65 and 75 years it is already over 90% of the population. When they reach 75 years of age, <br>
50% of the time, the vision was impaired.

## Therapy

The standard cataract treatment is an operation. A lens exchange is performed. <br>
The cloudy lens is replaced by a clear artificial lens, which usually consists of acrylic or silicone. <br>
With over 800,000 operations, the procedure is one of the most common in Germany and therefore very safe.<br>
It is usually performed on an outpatient basis, under local anesthesia and within 15-20 minutes.<br>
Patients can then look forward to greatly improved vision (50 - 100% visual performance after around 90% of operations).<br>
