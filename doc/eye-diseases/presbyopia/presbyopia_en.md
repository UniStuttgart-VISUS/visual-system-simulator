## Causes and development

As age increases, the lense hardens and suffers a drop in flexibility thus causing the eye to lose some of its capability to adjust the refractive power. This results in progressive worsening of the ability to focus clearly on close objects.  
It is generally considered not a disease, but rather a normal, age-related loss of function.

Other types of refractive errors may exist at the same time as presbyopia.

## Symptoms

With increasing age, sharp vision at short distances becomes more and more difficult. Newspapers and books for example must be kept further away from the eye for reading.<br>

Mean accommodation width and closest focus point in relation to age:

Age | Accommodation width (dpt) | Closest focus point (cm)
:---: | :---: | :---:
10 | 13.5 | 7.5
20 | 10.0 | 10.0
30 | 7.5 | 13.5
40 | 4.5 | 22.0
45 | 3.5 | 28.5
50 | 2.5 | 40.0
55 | 1.5 | 66.5
60 | 1.0 | 100.0
65 | 0.5 | 200.0
70 | 0.25 | 400.0

## Correction

Since the normal reading distance is approx. 40 cm, optical aids are usually required at the earliest at 45 years of age. Usually a refractive addition is carried out by means of glasses, on top of corrections for other refractive errors if applicable. In general, the weakest correction that allows comfortable close-up vision is applied. As presbyopia progresses, the glass thickness for close-up vision needs to be increased further and further.<br>

Reference values for a refractive addition depending on age to be considered:

Age | Correction (dpt)
:---: | :---:
40 - 45 | 0.75 to 1.0
50+ | 1.5 to 2.0
55+ | 2.25
60+ | 2.25 to 3.0

However, the strength of a close-up correction, which can vary greatly from person to person, always depends on the distance at which the majority of activities are to be performed. The following figures show average reference values. They apply to patients with fully developed presbyopia.

- For **reading newspapers** (≈ 50 cm) seated, an addition of +2.0 dpt is generally sufficient.
- When **reading lying down** (≈ 30 - 40 cm), the document is usually held closer to the eyes (near addition: +2.5 dpt to +3.0 dpt).
- For **handicraft work** (≈ 45 - 60 cm) e.g. for carpenters, tilers etc. a rather weak near addition (+1.5 dpt to +2.25 dpt) is recommended.
- For **screen activities** (≈ 60 - 80 cm) the distance to the monitor is usually relatively large (near addition: +1.0 dpt to +1.5 dpt).
- For people with **impaired visual acuity**, an overly strong refractive addition of +3.5 dpt to +5.0 dpt may be useful, which takes on the function of an enlarging visual aid.

##### Other means of correction

- Monovision: Adjust one eye for close objects by means of contact lenses
- Multifocal contact lenses
- Multifocal intraocular lenses
