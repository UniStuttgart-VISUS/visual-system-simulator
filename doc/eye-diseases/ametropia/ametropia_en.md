## Causes and development

Short-sightedness and far-sightedness cause a mismatch between the overall length of the eye and the refractive power of the lens. In general, the eyeball is too long (short-sightedness) or too short (far-sightedness).

Both short-sightedness and far-sightedness are predominantly genetic. However, it is assumed that the development of short-sightedness can be stimulated by external influences such as reading, school work, smartphone use and other close-up work during childhood.

## Symptoms

Depending on the type of ametropia, the projected image of infinitely distant objects is not focused on the retina when the eye is relaxed (not accommodated / adapted to the distance of the object), but in front of (for myopia) or behind (for hyperopia) the plane of the retina. This results in an imaging error that makes distant objects appear blurred in short-sightedness and vice versa.

## Correction

Eyeglasses, contact lenses and refractive surgery are common means of correction. Convex eyeglass lenses or lenses with positive refractive power are used to compensate for far-sightedness (hyperopia), and concave lenses or lenses with negative refractive power are used for short-sightedness (myopia).

##### Operations

Besides implant solutions (intraocular lenses), laser treatment is amongst the common surgical procedures. These, however, do not attempt to correct the proportions of the eyeball directly, but rather adapt / reduce the refractive power of the cornea by flattening the curvature of the anterior surface. This sort treatment is mainly applicable to cases of myopia.
