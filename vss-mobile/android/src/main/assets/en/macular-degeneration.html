<h2 id="causes-and-development">Causes and development</h2>
<p>Macular degeneration is a gradual destruction of the macula. The macula is the point in the eye where the highest concentration of cones can be found. It is therefore also the place of sharpest vision. A distinction is made between age-related macular degeneration and those caused by genetic defects or other factors, e.g. smoking.<br> <strong>Age-related</strong> macular degeneration is the most common form.<br><br> With increasing age, the waste products of the photoreceptors in the eye are not are sufficiently transported away and in some places form larger groups, so-called “druses”. The druses subsequently damage the retinal pigment epithelium.<br> This is called “geographical atrophy” and we speak of a <strong>“dry” macular degeneration</strong>.<br><br> If the damage leads to the destruction of the pigment epithelial cells, we speak of a <strong>“wet” macular degeneration</strong>.<br> Gaps develop in the membranes under the retinal layer and the blood supply to the retina is disturbed. <br> As a result, there is a lack of oxygen in some parts of the retina.<br> To counteract this, the body forms growth factors that stimulate the formation of small blood vessels. However, these vessels also grow into the gaps formed in the membranes under the retina. This can lead to retinal detachment.<br> Since the newly formed blood vessels have less robust walls, some fluid constantly escapes from them into the environment. Hence the term “wet” macular degeneration.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h2>
<p>In the early stages of the disease, there is often no noticeable change in vision for the patient. Since the disease is often in one eye, it is initially still successfully balanced by the healthy eye. Initial restrictions then show up, for example, when reading and the center of the read text appears blurred. <br><br> As the disease progresses, the symptoms become more pronounced. The patient notices an increasing decrease in visual acuity in the area of the focus point. This reduces the perception of contrast and colour. <br> Adaptation of the eye to changing light incidence is also disturbed and glare sensitivity increases. <br> In addition, there are metamorphopsies, distortions of the environment in the area of the focus point. These make e.g. straight text appear wavy.<br></p>
<p>If the disease is very advanced, blindness can occur (e.g. by detachment of the retina).</p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in western industrial countries. In Germany there are about 4.5 million affected people. About 25% of people over 65 years of age show signs of the disease.</p>
<h2 id="therapy">Therapy</h2>
<p>There is currently no treatment that can combat macular degeneration at its cause. <br> Therefore, current treatments are limited to slowing down the progress of the disease and alleviating the symptoms.</p>
<p>The specific therapy depends on the type of disease. In dry macular degeneration, for example, substances such as antioxidants are primarily prescribed to prevent damage to the pigment epithelium of the macula. <br> The therapy approach for wet macular degeneration, however, is the destruction of the newly formed blood vessels. This is achieved, for example, by laser treatment. The vessels are selectively sclerosed by laser. However, this form of treatment is only possible as long as the vessels are not directly in the macula. In addition, scars also occur in intact tissue, which can lead to a deterioration of vision.<br> An alternative treatment option is the injection of a non-toxic dye (into the arm vein). This deposits in the diseased vessels and makes them more sensitive to low-energy light. In this way, they are specifically destroyed without damaging surrounding healthy tissue.<br> Another, less radical form of treatment is the direct injection of antibody-containing drugs into the eyeball. There, they impair the effect of the growth factor that stimulates the formation of new blood vessels.</p>
