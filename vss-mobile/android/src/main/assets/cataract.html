<h2 id="causes-and-development">Causes and development</h2>
<p>In the case of cataract, the, otherwise clear, eye lens becomes cloudy. This can have a multitude of causes.<br> The most common form of cataract is the age-related cataract, which occurs from the age of 60. However, it can also be hereditary or <br> be caused by other risk factors. These include, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radiation exposure (UV light, lightning)</strong></li>
<li><strong>smoking / excessive alcohol consumption</strong></li>
<li><strong>myotonic dystrophy (hereditary muscle disease)</strong></li>
<li><strong>metabolic diseases such as diabetes</strong></li>
<li><strong>nutrient deficiency</strong></li>
<li><strong>medication (cortisone)</strong></li>
<li><strong>for newborns: damage during pregnancy</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h2>
<p>Cataract is characterized by increasingly blurred vision and increased glare sensitivity. <br> Other symptoms are low-contrast vision and the impression of looking through a veil or fog.<br> The symptoms can initially be limited to smaller regions and only take up the entire field of vision as the disease progresses.</p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>In Germany between 52 and 64 years approx. 50% of the population suffer from cataracts, but without being aware of them.<br> In the age group between 65 and 75 years it is already over 90% of the population. When they reach 75 years of age, <br> 50% of the time, the vision was impaired.</p>
<h2 id="therapy">Therapy</h2>
<p>The standard cataract treatment is an operation. A lens exchange is performed. <br> The cloudy lens is replaced by a clear artificial lens, which usually consists of acrylic or silicone. <br> With over 800,000 operations, the procedure is one of the most common in Germany and therefore very safe.<br> It is usually performed on an outpatient basis, under local anesthesia and within 15-20 minutes.<br> Patients can then look forward to greatly improved vision (50 - 100% visual performance after around 90% of operations).<br></p>
